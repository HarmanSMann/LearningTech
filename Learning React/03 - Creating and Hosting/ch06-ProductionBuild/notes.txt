The build folder will be copied voer to the node.js, server side because we are tring to use node

app.get(/^(?!\/api).+/, (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../build/index.html'));
})

checks for the api locaiton, and setups use for client code

when you are looking for setting it upp, we need to setup an offical port to use too, like the .env stuff
