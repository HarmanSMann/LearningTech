For the Login pg you can do something like this to provide extra context
JWT - Json tokens, 
mostly used and are incoded information about the uiser to make life easier.

How are they used:
step 1 - user logs incoded
2 - server generates a token with the user information
3 - server send the token to the user
4 - front end stores it for uses (cookies)
5 - front end uses the token whenever it needs to move through things, like the privileges you had during the project
6 - uses the signature to verify uses
