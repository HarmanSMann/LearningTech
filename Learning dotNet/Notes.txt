dotnet run to run 
dotnet new console

really similar to C back when you learned it

Finished opverview, it is the basics of C
Program flow follows how we do the conditional statements and how operations continue to function
    one good usecase is videogames. 
        -> enemy designs and how they react to seeing the player character
        -> while player seen, chase

    Follows, if,m switch, while, for, breaks, continue, exceptions
    using foreach instead of for
        foreach (i in n) { do something }
        foreach (char c in str) { do something }
    using do while look
        do { something }  while (condition)
