dotnet new console

stuff is outdated, running version 5, but version 7 is out.

really similar to C back when you learned it

Finished opverview, it is the basics of C
Program flow follows how we do the conditional statements and how operations continue to function
    one good usecase is videogames. 
        -> enemy designs and how they react to seeing the player character
        -> while player seen, chase

    Follows, if,m switch, while, for, breaks, continue, exceptions
    using foreach instead of for
        foreach (i in n) { do something }
        foreach (char c in str) { do something }
    using do while look
        do { something }  while (condition)

Interesting Use
        public string Name {
            get {
                return _name;
            }
            set {
                _name = value;
            }
        }

            public string Author {
            get => _author;
            set => _author = value;
        }
